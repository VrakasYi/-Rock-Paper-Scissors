I used 
functions to randomize the computer choice variable.
If conditions to determine the winner.
While loop to have the game repeat for 5 rounds


I experienced a bit of error handling ofcourse

The process can be improved by randomly selecting items from an array/list

Maybe a seperate function for score keeping

A tiebraker can also be included
